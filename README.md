# Description 

Full-Stack application developed for free thinking people who want to use our forum to think and create posts. Users can create, edit, and view posts sorted by the topic of the users choice. Anyone who visits our Web Application is shown a login page where the client can set up a username and password. After they are logged in the client can post or comment on whatever categories that already exist or if the user thinks about a new category they can freely comment on things that already exists.


# Functionality 
Users can Sign-Up for an account and Sign-In to the Web Application. From there, they can choose to create posts, search for posts based on category, or edit their existing posts. The Web Application yes simple but the way that it can be iproved now that we've learned MERN in the future there can be alot of implementation of ways to further the Application.
